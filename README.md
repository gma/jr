# [DEPRECATED] jr (Job Runner)

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

jr is yet another Job Runner, born out of the need to run multiple copies
of a job in parallel.

You interact with jr over HTTP, via a REST API. Check app.rb to work out how to use it; it's very simple.
